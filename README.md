# Git Structure

 An outline of the branches can be found below:

master: This is reserved for production ready code. This should be updated with every major/minor change to the code. All changes to this branch should be made with a pull request originating from development
development: The development branch is the shared "work in progress" branch. When once a new feature is ready a pull request should be submitted to this branch. When enough changes have been made a pull request will be made into master
dev-$name: This is considered a personal development branch. It is completely your own, so feel free to make as many commits/changes to it as you like! When you've completed something substantial submit a pull request into development for review.
All changes to development and master should have been reviewed before merging. Upon each update to the master branch the version number should be changed accordingly, as well as tagged.

# Tips:

Before making a pull request make sure that you've pulled the latest changes from your branch, as well as the target branch you're merging into
Make sure that all tests have passed successfully
